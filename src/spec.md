- Update role selector dropdowns in Member Management page to include all MC ranks
- Add unique icons for each rank in Members roster page (crown for President, star for Vice President, compass for Road Captain, clipboard for Secretary, shield for Sergeant at Arms, dollar sign for Treasurer, fist for Enforcer, shield-check for Tail Gunner, heart for Chaplain, user-plus for Prospect, user for Member)
