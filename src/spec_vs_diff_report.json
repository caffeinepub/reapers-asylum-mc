  "summary": "The implementation covers most of the core requirements including homepage, members roster, events calendar, authentication, news feed, and photo gallery. The visual theme with dark colors, metallic accents, and motorcycle club aesthetics is consistently applied. However, some backend functionality appears incomplete or missing, particularly regarding authorization checks and admin-specific features.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Only authorized users can view the full roster",
      "reason": "The members page (MembersPage.tsx) only checks for authentication (!identity) but does not implement the authorization logic to restrict full roster access. The backend getMembers() function appears to be public without access control checks visible in the truncated code.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Administrators can post announcements and updates",
      "reason": "While PostNewsForm component exists for posting news, there is no visible check restricting this form to administrators only in NewsPage.tsx. The useIsCallerAdmin hook exists but is not utilized to conditionally render the posting form.",

      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Backend stores photo metadata and references",
      "reason": "While the backend includes MixinStorage for blob storage, there is no evidence in the diff of specific photo gallery storage methods, photo metadata types, or photo retrieval functions. GalleryPage.tsx is missing from the diff entirely.",

      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Photos display in a responsive grid layout with click to view full-size",

      "description": "Event type categorization system",
      "reason": "The implementation includes an EventType enum with categories (ride, meeting, social, fundraiser, other) which was not specified in the requirements. REQ-3 only mentions 'rides, meetings, and club events' as examples without requesting a type system.",
