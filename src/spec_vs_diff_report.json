  "summary": "The implementation covers all 8 requirements (REQ-14 through REQ-21) for the member management interface. Backend functions for add, update, and delete members with admin-only access control are present. Frontend includes a comprehensive MemberManagementPage with forms, validation, edit/delete interfaces, role dropdown, and toast notifications. The Members roster page now fetches members dynamically from backend with loading/empty states. A navbar link to the member management page is visible only to admins. All acceptance criteria appear to be satisfied based on the diff evidence.",
